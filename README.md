Hello, my name is Y, I'm currently a University student studying computer science. I mainly do projects in python, javascript, and occasionally c/c++.

Im interested in Neural Networks and Deep Learning as well as Quantaum Computers, I've worked with the cloud-based quantum computer hosted by IBM and had access to GTB-1 when it was first released. I am excited to see where the future of technology takes us.
